# Hudu SharePoint Migration
Easy Migration from SharePoint to Hudu

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Hudu Instance of 2.37.1 or newer
- Companies created in Hudu if you want to attribute sharepoint items to companies
- Hudu API Key
- SharePoint / Sites with Files
- Powershell 7.5.0 or later
- Libreoffice **(script will start install if not present)**
- Read permissions for SharePoint **(script will register app in entra if not manually set)**

### Setup Azure AppRegistration

#### Auto-Registration
If you haven't entered your ClientId (AppId) and TenantId from Microsoft, you can complete Azure App Registration within this script. Please follow the prompts carefully for a smooth process.

Since we are using Microsoft's `MSAL authentication module` with `Device Auth`, you'll need to ensure that 'Public Client Flows' is switched-on. You can do this manually, otherwise this blade will be opened up automatically.

**At the end, you'll be given the option to remove this app registration**

#### Manual-Registration
Otherwise, if you want to set up Azure/Entra AppRegistration manually, you'll need to set up with the permissions below, then place the ClientID (AppId) and TenantID in the top of the main script.
```
delegatedPermissions: "Sites.Read.All", "Files.Read.All", "User.Read", "offline_access"
applicationPermissions: "Files.Read.All", "Sites.Read.All"
```

## Getting Started
This script will check the PowerShell version, get all the necessary modules loaded, prompt you to sign into Hudu, check the Hudu version, and make sure you're authenticated to SharePoint.

You'll be asked to copy a code for authenticating via Microsoft Device Login. Simply copy the generated code and paste it after going to Microsoft's device authentication page, [here](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/deviceauth) in a web browser. Sign into Office/Azure/Entra as you usually would.

Just before the file conversion process begins, this script will download and install the graphical installer for Libreoffice, if not install already. Simply go through all the questions with default values, as the desired install path has already been set for you. If you already have Libreoffice installed, it will pick up on that and use the version you already have.

## Supported Files?

All files can be added if they are either
-under 100mb in size
-under 8500 Characters long when converted to html

Otherwise we just link to original file on SharePoint

### Document files
#### work nicely and any of the below should convert nicely:
```
- ".pdf"
- ".doc"
- ".docx"
- ".docm"
- ".rtf"
- ".txt"
- ".md"
- ".wpd"
- ".odt"
```

### Spreadsheets and Tabular Data
#### can be converted if you like, but any formulae will be replaced. If you plan on editing tabular data frequently, you might elect to not convert these"
```
- ".xls"
- ".xlsx"
- ".csv"
- ".ods"
```

### Powerpoints and Presentations
#### These can be converted to a simplified html equivilent. Each slide has it's data / images extracted
```
- ".ppt"
- ".pptx"
- ".pptm"
- ".odp"
```

### All others:
#### All others will skip conversion process and will be uploaded directly if **under 100mb in size**. If they are **over 100mb in size**, we just create a stub article that has a link to the sharepoint file in question.

All other non-document files skip conversion and are uploaded with a simple Hudu article containing file details.

most common formats that we skip conversion for are:
```
".mp3", ".wav", ".flac", ".aac", ".ogg", ".wma", ".m4a", ".dll", ".so", ".lib", ".bin", ".class", ".pyc", ".pyo", ".o", ".obj", ".exe", ".msi", ".bat", ".cmd", ".sh", ".jar", ".app", ".apk", ".dmg", ".iso", ".img", ".zip", ".rar", ".7z", ".tar", ".gz", ".bz2", ".xz", ".tgz", ".lz", ".mp4", ".avi", ".mov", ".wmv", ".mkv", ".webm", ".flv", ".psd", ".ai", ".eps", ".indd", ".sketch", ".fig", ".xd", ".blend", ".ds_store", ".thumbs", ".lnk", ".heic"
```

Files that **don't have an extension**, we'll attempt to decode these as UTF-8

Files that aren't traditional documents will have a page generated for them with your chosen links. Here's what an image in sharepoint will look like after adding to Hudu:

### If a file is too large after conversion (longer than 8500 characters or 100mb)
if this condition is met, the original is uploaded in Hudu and Linked

#### Effectively, here's the process:
1. Select desired SharePoint Site(s)
2. Download all files from selected sites
3. Convert those that can be converted
4. Those that can be converted- Parse links, extract images, etc
5. Those that can't - generate a useful landing page for file


## FAQs:

#### Q: Does my original SharePoint Folder Structure Carry Over?
A: Yes. If you select a company to attribute an article to, the original folder structure is retained for that article

#### Q: What does a PowerPoint file look like after converting into Hudu?
A: Pretty basic. Information from each slide is extracted, including images. This information is extracted into a web-friendly Article

#### Q: What does a Spreadsheet file look like after converting into Hudu?
A: It constructs an HTML table from your spreadsheet. Large spreadsheets are less manageable and any-sized spreadsheet will lose its formulae. It can be good for making sure information from SharePoint is searchable and findable in Hudu, however.
